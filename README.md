# 👋 Hi, I’m Raisa Vigo Fonseca

I’m a **Programmer Analyst** specializing in **SQL & ETL development, data analytics, and AI-driven automation**. I design, optimize, and maintain data pipelines, databases, and intelligent workflows that transform complex data into reliable insights and reduce manual work.

My background includes building production-grade **SQL Server and Oracle** solutions, developing ETL pipelines with **IBM DataStage and SSIS**, and delivering analytics in regulated **finance, insurance, and healthcare** environments. I recently completed the **TripleTen AI Automation Specialist Bootcamp**, where I built AI-powered and agent-based workflows using tools like **n8n, UiPath, Zapier, and Make**, with a strong focus on **prompt engineering** and API-driven automation.
