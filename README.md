# 👋 Hi, I’m Raisa Vigo Fonseca

I’m a **Programmer Analyst** focused on **SQL & ETL development, data analytics, and AI automation**. I build and optimize databases, ETL pipelines, and reporting layers that turn complex data into reliable insights and reduce manual work.

I have hands-on experience with **SQL Server, Oracle, SSIS, IBM DataStage**, and BI tools like **Power BI and Tableau**, working in regulated finance, insurance, and healthcare environments. I recently completed the **TripleTen AI Automation Specialist Bootcamp**, where I developed AI-driven workflows to streamline business processes.
