# 👋 Hi, I’m Raisa Vigo Fonseca

I’m a **Programmer Analyst** specializing in **SQL & ETL development, data analytics, and AI-driven automation**.  
I design, optimize, and maintain data pipelines, databases, and intelligent workflows that turn complex data into reliable insights and reduce manual work.

My background includes building production-grade SQL Server and Oracle solutions, developing ETL pipelines with **IBM DataStage and SSIS**, and delivering analytics for regulated finance, insurance, and healthcare environments. Recently, I expanded my skill set into **AI automation and agent-based workflows** to further improve business efficiency and decision-making.
